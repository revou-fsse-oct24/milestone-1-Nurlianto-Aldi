# Behind The Scene of The Web Development Process

## Reference

I start with creating a mood board on Pinterest. At first, i still don't know what company profile i want to create, but then i got inspired by one of the ghibli food art and decided to make a website for a ghibli themed restaurant.

## Planning

I thinking about using figma to make the prototype, but then i think it will take a lot of time and i have limited time to fill the assignment. So i start to scratch my pencil on the paper and doing the manual. At least it works.

## Start with The Structure

I open my VS Code and do some clone from Github (the assignment repo), and start working on the HTML Code. I use semantic HTML and write a comment to each section.

## Styling with Vanilla CSS

Lucky for me because the assignment doesn't require me to style it with tailwind -because confused with it, so i'm using vanilla CSS. setting up a few custom font, some general settings, and some templates.

## Add Responsiveness

I add media querie for mobile phone and tablet. the breakpoint is 768 and 408, but unfortunately, to have a smooth transition between different resolution i need to add another resolution (922px and 600px). I don't know if it's allowed but it worked for the smooth transition.

## Deploy and Using Custom Domain

After everything is done, i do some commit and do some push to the github. Setting up a few things on netlify and deploy the website from github. The custom domain unfortunately is the same from a previous, so the name a little bit different from the actual website. But the point is, the assignment is done.
